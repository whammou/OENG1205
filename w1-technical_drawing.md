# 1. Engineering Design Process


The engineering process is **a series of steps** that engineers follow to come up with a **solution to a problem**

The process is highly **iterative** - parts of the process often need to be **repeated many times** before another can e entered 

The process changes **depending** on how the engineering product innovate is driven, whether
- **Demand-Pull innovation**
- **Invention-Push**


## 1.1 Problem/Product Definition


To identify the requirement for the product sometimes called:
- Product Planning
- Need Analysis
- Task Classification

Typically, one of the most critical design step for the **New Product Development (NPD)**

The task is given to `engineers` and `designers` by the `marketing department` or `client` to provide a comprehensive **Product Design Specification (PDS)** decument which includes a requirement list factors:
- Technical
- Economic
- Quality


## 1.2 Conceptual Design


An early phase of the *Product Design Process*, in which the broad outlines of the function and form of something are articulated


## 1.3 Preliminary Design


More detailed engineering design/analysis calculation are performed on at least the major elements of the component

> [!NOTE]
> Also referred as **embodiment design**
> Which may involve another three sub-stages:
> - Product architecture
> - Design configuration
> - Parametric design


## 1.3 Detailed Design


> [!NOTE]
> The **Preliminary Design** is completed and `detailed specification` of each part and assembly is produced

Detailed design may include:
- Detailed drawing
- OEM component specification
- Bill of materials (BOM)
- Production notes
- Operation instructions


## 1.4 Design Communication


To communicate the results in the form of:
- Reports
- Presentations
- Display boards *or a combination of methods*

Through `documentation` allows the finished product to be manufactured to the required **quality standards**
